# Steal The Deal

E-commerce is a process of doing business through computer networks. Unlike traditional commerce that is carried out physically with effort of a person to go and get products, e-commerce has made it easier for humans to reduce physical work and save time.
Our project Steal The Deal is an e-commerce website where we tried to mimic other e-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart etc. This is to make the online shopping experience smooth, less time consuming and more productive.
The aim of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where products can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. Thus, it was required to create a site which handles online payments.
